    <h5>C-DIT: SURGING AHEAD IN THE ERA OF DIGITAL REVOLUTION</h5>
</div>

<!--Welcome to c-dit-->
<div class="one">

<p>
    Centre for Development of Imaging Technology, C-DIT, a Government of Kerala organization under Electronics and Information Technology, with corporate culture is concerned with customizing technology for the masses. Having its genesis in 1988 from a perception to use imaging technology as a tool to achieve progress, C-DIT has lived up to that dream. When Information Technology began to kick start growth in all spheres of economy and life, C-DIT quickly adapted to it. In fact, it established a synergy between Information Technology and Imaging Technology to create new paradigms of information 
    dissemination through apt image making. Now C-DIT has evolved into a resourceful and productive agency of the Government of Kerala under the chairmanship of Hon. Chief Minister. It has made its mark in the advancement of research, development and training in Imaging Technology and in socially relevant science and development communication.
<br>
<br>
C-DIT has a talented pool of creative personnel co-existing with technological work force. It is an approved research centre of Department of Science and Industrial Research (DSIR) and Kerala University. The head office of C-DIT is currently housed in a 3-acre Campus in the picturesque Chithranjali Hills, 6 kms from Thiruvananthapuram Central, on the way to Kovalam. It also has City Offices in Thiruvananthapuram city. The 3 regional centres of C-DIT are functioning in Kayamkulam, Ernakulam and Kannur.
<br>
<br>
It was at the application level of Optoelectronics and Information Technology that C-DIT rendered exemplary service to the people. The high security holograms produced by C-DIT are now being used in key sectors of Kerala for authenticating and ensuring genuineness and security. The three hundred plus C-DIT’s educational partners all over Kerala have already become an integral part of IT education in the State, offering courses with Kerala PSC recognition.
<br>
<br>
C-DIT’s ventures in live web streaming, Ration Card Renewal Project, Digitisation projects, Facility Management Service, Multimedia Learning Objects for ICT enabled education, software development, Malayalam language computing, digital archiving, ICT technical consultancy for e-governance and the self reliance achieved in hologram production are indeed laudable. In these days of severe energy crunch C-DIT has once again braced up to face the challenge by launching projects focusing green energy technologies, especially renewable solar energy resources etc..
<br>
<br>
The Government of Kerala has been supporting C-DIT in many technology applications, especially the ones that facilitated smooth and effective interaction between the Government and the public. In the interface between the Government and the people, out-reach of administration, achieving transparency and security in realization of projects, C-DIT made its positive presence felt in the last twenty eight years. As the key agency, providing required and timely support in the domain of ICT and allied programmes to the Government of Kerala, C-DIT is setting up benchmarks of its own.
<br>
Over the past 30 years of its existence, C-DIT has taken up many prestigious projects of the Government of Kerala and completed them successfully.
